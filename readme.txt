Notifies Odoo about a new order on WooCommerce.


== Description ==

This plugin sends a notification to the Odoo website when a new order is created on the WooCommerce website.
In two minutes the Odoo website sends a request to the WooCommerce website to get the new order data and then saves it as a new order on the Odoo website.

Requires WooCommerce API v3 (it is available on WooCommerce 3.5.x or later and WordPress 4.4 or later)
And Odoo 11 or later

On the Odoo website the [Enotif WooCommerce Order](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/17.0/enotif_woo_order/) module should be installed.

For Odoo Online (or if you cannot install third party modules) there is a modified version of this plugin that uses odoo API to send orders.
